# Static New Tab

A Chromium extension (built for [Helium](https://helium.computer), works in any
Chromium-based browser) that keeps a **New Tab page pinned** in every window.

- **Type a URL, search, or click a shortcut** in the pinned tab → it becomes a
  regular tab, moved to the end of the tab strip (where `+` / Ctrl+T would have
  put it), and a fresh pinned New Tab takes its place.
- **Press `+` or Ctrl+T** → no extra tab is left behind: you land on the pinned
  New Tab.
- **Close the pinned tab** → it comes back.
- **New windows** get their own pinned New Tab.

The extension uses the browser's own New Tab page (or whichever New Tab
extension you use). It doesn't replace the page.

## Install (unpacked)

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Helium.
3. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and pick this folder.

It asks for the `tabs` permission (shown as "Read your browsing history").
It needs this to see when the pinned tab leaves the New Tab page. Nothing is
stored or sent anywhere. The only state is a tab-ID-per-window map in
`chrome.storage.session`.

## How it works

`+` doesn't close the new tab and jump back to the pinned one. Instead, **the
new tab takes over the pinned slot** and the old pinned New Tab is closed. The
result looks the same, but the keyboard focus stays in the address bar, so
Ctrl+T followed by typing still works. If the extension activated an existing
tab instead, focus would return to wherever it was last in that tab.

The pinned tab is tracked by ID. Your other pinned tabs (mail, chat…) are never
touched.

## Known limitations

- **A brief flicker.** Extensions can only react after the browser has created
  or navigated a tab, so for a split second you may see the tab appear unpinned,
  or the navigated tab jump from the pinned area to the end of the strip.
- **"Where it would have been" means the end of the strip.** This is where
  Chromium puts new tabs from `+` / Ctrl+T. If your browser opens new tabs next
  to the current one, change the `index: -1` in `release()` in `background.js`.
- **Closing the last tab no longer closes the window.** The pinned New Tab is
  still there. Close it, or the window, to finish.
- **Ctrl+1…8 shift by one.** The pinned tab now counts as a tab.
- **Back button.** A tab that started on the pinned New Tab can go *back* to the
  New Tab page, the same as a tab opened with Ctrl+T.
- **Restore after a crash** can briefly bring back an extra pinned New Tab. The
  extension removes duplicates.
- **Incognito** windows are left alone unless you allow the extension in
  incognito on `chrome://extensions`.
